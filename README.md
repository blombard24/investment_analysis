# investment_analysis

This repo contains python scripts for investment and stock market analysis.

## account_growth.ipynb
account_growth.ipynb is a python script to analyze the growth of $10,000 dollars over a given timeframe. The script allows you to choose any number of valid stock/etf/mutual fund tickers which can be passed into the main function along with a timeframe to analyze and visualize the growth of $10,000. The function includes parameters for DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) and calculation type. Calculation type can include oldest possible date for all tickers or other which standardizes the intial investment to the youngest tickers start date to ensure all tickers start at the same time. 

The main function is fully functional, but this script is still a work in progress.
